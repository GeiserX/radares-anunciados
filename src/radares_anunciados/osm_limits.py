"""The speed limit of the road under a radar whose source publishes none.

DGT fixed and section radars, and OpenStreetMap cameras without ``maxspeed``,
come with no limit, so their zones fall back on the road class (``speed.py``).
This lookup asks OpenStreetMap instead: every drivable way within ``AROUND_M``
of each radar, many radars per Overpass query (the ~800 DGT points of Spain
cost 3), and keeps the ``maxspeed`` of the way the radar is on:

- the radar's road, when its name gives one ("A-7") and a way near it has that
  ``ref``; with none, only a carriageway the radar is on (``TIE_M``) of a class
  that road could be (``CARRIAGEWAY``): never a slip road, a roundabout street
  or another road nearby;
- a main carriageway before a service road or a slip road;
- of those, the nearest. Its limit, or nothing: a limit is never borrowed from
  another road, nor from the other carriageway.

``maxspeed`` values that are not one number in km/h: "55 mph" is converted,
"ES:motorway", "ES:rural" and "ES:zoneNN" are Spain's implicit limits, and
anything that is no single limit ("ES:urban", "none", "walk", "80;90", a
``maxspeed:forward`` that differs from ``:backward`` on a two-way road) gives
none: a wrong limit in the zone's name is worse than none.

Every answer, a limit or none, is kept per radar position in the cache folder
and asked again after 30 days, so a run asks only for radars it has not seen or
whose answer is that old. An answer is replaced only by a query that worked: a
failed query (an error, or Overpass's "remark" of a timeout or out of memory)
keeps the old answer, leaves a new radar without a limit (the road fallback
sizes it), caches nothing and is retried next run. A zone's name and radius
follow its limit, so a limit that came and went with Overpass's health would
delete and recreate the zone.
